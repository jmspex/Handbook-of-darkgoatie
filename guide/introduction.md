### Beggining with discord.js
Here, i'll guide you through 'discord.js'. 
I made this guide because [discord.js docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/) makes absolutely **0 sense** to beginners.
Still there is [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/), but it's way too oversimplified.

Please follow the order I give you while checking files, this is for your own good. 
If you don't follow that order and spoonfeed yourself from this repository, it'll be bad for your programming knowledge.

> Now, please head to [/guide/Begin.md](https://github.com/Darkgoatie/Darkgoatie-s-guide-to-discord.js/blob/main/guide/begin.md) .
