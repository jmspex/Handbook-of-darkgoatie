## Guide to embeds

In discord.js, you can send an embed in 2 ways:
```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');

const exampleEmbed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
.setTitle('Darkgoatie\'s guide to discord.js') // We used a `\` before the `'`, for preventing it from creating a new string and breaking the command.

```
